## Early Life and Education
The late Richard Asante was born in Accra on Tuesday, 27th June, 1978 to Opanyin
Kofi Safo-Asante of the Kwahu-Mpraeso Asona family and Madam Felicia Asor Sasu of the Kwahu-Mpraeso Aduana family, both of blessed memory. He was the fifth child among six siblings of his parents and the eleventh of his father. Richard’s early childhood development started at Adabraka in Accra up to age 5, and continued at Taifa, a suburb of Accra after his parent’s moved to settle in their own residence at Taifa. The late Pharm Richard Asante’s basic education therefore began at the New Star Preparatory School at Taifa in Accra from 1983 to 1989. After a successful completion of primary education, he was taken to City Business College(CIBUSCO) where he completed the 3 years course.

Thereafter, courtesy his senior brother, Pharm Samuel Asante-Boateng, he entered the Christian Methodist Secondary School through a successful late entrance
examination for his secondary education from 1992 to 1995, where he wrote the General Certificate of Education Ordinary level (G.C.E ‘O’level). By dint of his
studious lifestyle he was able to qualify to the next level on the academic ladder; and thus, had his 6th form education at the then Accra Polytechnic, now Accra Technical
University from 1995 to 1997. His usual wonderful performance gained him admission into Abetifi Training College where he did his Teachers Cert ‘A’. Richard
Asante exhibited his prowess one more time and successfully completed his teacher training in the year 1999.

As a trained teacher, Richard was posted to teach at the then Kpobikorpe M/A primary, now Kpobilorpe M/A Basic School. An account of him indicated that though his engagement was very brief at his station, he was an inspiring teacher who left an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of all he came into contact with, both
casually and intensly. During the second year of his teaching profession, he was encouraged by his senior brother, Pharm Asante-Boateng to take the Senior High
School certificate examination and he obliged. He came out with remarkable performance and filed an application to offer Medicine at the Medical school at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). The late Pharm
Richard was rather offered a course in pharmacy instead of his choice for medicine. In 2002, Richard Asante was offered the Pharmacy course at KNUST where he read
B.Pharm (Hons) and completed in the year 2006.

Mr. Asante, did not end his educational journey there, he took it further and obtained Master’s degree in Master of Arts in Human Resource Development at the University of Cape Coast in the year 2012

Pharm Asante took another second degree and obtained Master of Science in Logistics and Supply Chain Management at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in 2016.

Pharm Richard Asante wanted to crown his remarkable academic pursuit with the top-up program to earn Doctor of Pharmacy but he gave up the ghost in the latter part of his second year when he was doing his rotation at the GPHA Hospital,
Takoradi.

Mr. Asante constantly made time with his family despite all the stress from hard work and his numerous travels until his demise.

## Religious Life 

Richard was baptized at an early age into the Presbyterian church of Ghana. For many years, he continued regular worship at the PCG, Ramseyer Congregation, Taifa from where he received the confirmation to signify his acceptance of the Lord Jesus Christ as his personal savior and became a full communicant as well. He was a devoted Christian and worshipped with PCG Ramseyer Congregation, Taifa. He
relocated to his residence at Royal City, Amasaman in 2016 and transferred his membership to his current congregation, PCG, Grace Family Aborkope, a suburb of Accra. At his new congregation, he diligently served the church in every possible way until his sad exit unto glory.

## Character

Pharm Richard Asante, nothwistanding his unexpected departure at such a period in his life, impacted his family, friends and even the distant person. In fact, his life positively influenced all who came into contact with him. It was characteristic of Richard to help even those he knew would waste his resource. He was peaceful and a principled individual. He sought after education for all his
family members, he would force you take education as he understood to the very depths of the benefits of education in our ever racing world system. Mr. Asante will forever be remembered by all and sundry. He never stopped his good works until his last breath on the 23rd Day of March, 2024
at the International Maritime Hospital, Tema Community 3.
Indeed, the Asante family has really lost a gem.

## Conclusion

As Paul wrote in His second epistle to Timothy, chapter 4 and verses 7 and 8, we are of the firm belief that “You have fought the good fight, you have finished the race,
you have kept the faith. Finally, there is laid up for you the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to you on that day, and not to you only
but also to all who have loved His appearing”. As we lay Pharm Richard Asante to rest today, may the Almighty God grant him rest from his labour. 

Sleep well!

Rest in Peace in the Bosom of the Lord till we meet again in the afterlife.

## Rest Well Pharm Richard Asante.

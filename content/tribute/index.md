*<span style="color:darkblue;font-weight:500;font-size:10px">
“When peace like a river attendeth my way.
When sorrows like seas billows roll
Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say
It is well, with my soul
”
</span>*

How can l write your tribute so early when life is steadily getting better?
The journey with you  begun  way back in year 2000 where the two of us were posted to teach in a small village called Kpobikope. The two of us travelled on our bicycles to impact lives that were put in our hands. After teaching for two years, one morning during our usual break time ,you told me you’ll like to go for further studies. My response was that “it was a great decision to better our future”. I had to support you in my small capacity through your studies. I waited patiently to see you complete your course. Indeed “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up withs wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint”.

We always encouraged each other to develop and become better in everything we do. Our dream was towards our bright pension and now Papa Surgy where are you?

I cannot believe that I am mourning your mortal remains today. As for Raphael he will always tell his brothers when they are worrying  him that “when Daddy comes….”.how am I going to explain things to him to get it that you are not coming back soon?

You left us on Monday 18th March, 2024 and you were brought speechless and motionless on Wednesday 20th March, 2024 until you gave up your last breath on Saturday 23rd March,2024.

Kwabena eiiii! where are you?

There is never a dull moment whenever you were around . There is always joy wherever you were .Your popular remark “when God blesses you ,you too bless somebody”. You have fulfilled this by letting anyone who came your way had a positive impact from you. You provided everything we needed. All we are left with is your memories.

My husband, a father, a confidant , a friend and a brother; where are you to enjoy the fruit of your labour?

Well; I will leave everything to God, who is the great comforter and a consoler. Surgical thank you for the spirit of love and unity you sowed in us. We are so grateful.

Kwabena Konadu, the word of God says, when a good person dies, he becomes an intercessor for others. Be an intercessor for your family you left behind. May your good works find you a resting place in the bosom of your Creator who has called you till we meet again.

Asante; I am bidding you goodbye with your favourite hymn from Bill and Gloria Gaither which we sang together when there were challenged moments.

*<span style="color:darkblue;font-weight:500;font-size:10px">
"And then one day we’ll all cross that river and fight life final war with pain.
And then as death give way to victory
We’ll see the light of glory and l will know he reigns
Because Christ lives we can face tomorrow
Because Christ lives all fear is gone!
And now l know; Yes, l know He holds the future 
A life is worth a living just
Because Christ lives ”</span>*


My love, rest well,

Papa Surgy, nante yie,

Richard, ya wo odjogban,

Daddy ,nade  nyuie.



## Tribute From Children

There’s nothing sad and painful in this world than watching someone you love so much pass away gradually and not being able to do anything.

On that fateful Wednesday, Mummy asked us to pray fervently because you were in a critical condition. We were hoping to celebrate you back home. Little did we know that a day like this will come.

Daddy, why so early? You were really a great Dad so loving and caring, even for those who are not your biological children. You really had everybody at heart. Truthfulness and humility your rod that guides us. And this is what you have taught us to do. Daddy, we are grateful.

Indeed, our thoughts are not that of the Lord’s, neither our ways are his ways. We strongly believe everything happens for a reason and God does not make mistakes. It is sometimes difficult to accept certain decisions of God, but He knows best.

Daddy, though we stand here with our heavy hearts, we have the assurance that, because you lived a life that glorified God, your maker is going to give you a wonderful place in paradise to intercede on our behalf.

Daddy, to us, as you always travel, this time is one of the many trips. Until we meet again. We love you and you’ll forever remain the best Daddy in our hearts.

Daddy rest well.

## Tribute From Class of 2006, KNUST

It is with a heavy heart and fond memories that we write this tribute to our beloved classmate, Pharm. Richard Asante. Our paths first crossed in 2002, when we entered the revered halls of the Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi. From the outset, Richard's affable and easy-going nature made him a cherished member of our cohort.

Known to most of us by his popular nickname, "Surgical", Richard's real name remained a mystery to many until our graduation in 2006. This playful anonymity was a testament to his unique charm and the camaraderie we shared during those formative years at the University.

Richard had a clear vision for his future, even during our university days. He aspired to work within the regulatory sector, a path he diligently pursued upon graduation. True to his ambition, Richard joined the Pharmacy Council, where he became an invaluable resource for all of us. Whether it was registration, renewal, or any other regulatory matters, Richard was our go-to person, always ready to lend a helping hand.

Indeed, Richard, or "Surgical" as we fondly remember him, has left behind an indelible legacy. He was not just a resourceful professional, but also a caring individual who cherished his family and friends. His affable nature, combined with his dedication to his chosen field, made him a role model for many of us.

As we remember Richard, we celebrate his life and the positive impact he had on all of us. His legacy will continue to inspire us, reminding us of the importance of friendship, dedication, and service to others. Richard, you will be sorely missed, but your memory will live on in our hearts. Rest in peace, dear friend.

<p><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
“When peace like a river attendeth my way.
When sorrows like seas billows roll
Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say
It is well, with my soul
”
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></p>
<p>How can l write your tribute so early when life is steadily getting better?
The journey with you  begun  way back in year 2000 where the two of us were posted to teach in a small village called Kpobikope. The two of us travelled on our bicycles to impact lives that were put in our hands. After teaching for two years, one morning during our usual break time ,you told me you’ll like to go for further studies. My response was that “it was a great decision to better our future”. I had to support you in my small capacity through your studies. I waited patiently to see you complete your course. Indeed “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up withs wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint”.</p>
<p>We always encouraged each other to develop and become better in everything we do. Our dream was towards our bright pension and now Papa Surgy where are you?</p>
<p>I cannot believe that I am mourning your mortal remains today. As for Raphael he will always tell his brothers when they are worrying  him that “when Daddy comes….”.how am I going to explain things to him to get it that you are not coming back soon?</p>
<p>You left us on Monday 18th March, 2024 and you were brought speechless and motionless on Wednesday 20th March, 2024 until you gave up your last breath on Saturday 23rd March,2024.</p>
<p>Kwabena eiiii! where are you?</p>
<p>There is never a dull moment whenever you were around . There is always joy wherever you were .Your popular remark “when God blesses you ,you too bless somebody”. You have fulfilled this by letting anyone who came your way had a positive impact from you. You provided everything we needed. All we are left with is your memories.</p>
<p>My husband, a father, a confidant , a friend and a brother; where are you to enjoy the fruit of your labour?</p>
<p>Well; I will leave everything to God, who is the great comforter and a consoler. Surgical thank you for the spirit of love and unity you sowed in us. We are so grateful.</p>
<p>Kwabena Konadu, the word of God says, when a good person dies, he becomes an intercessor for others. Be an intercessor for your family you left behind. May your good works find you a resting place in the bosom of your Creator who has called you till we meet again.</p>
<p>Asante; I am bidding you goodbye with your favourite hymn from Bill and Gloria Gaither which we sang together when there were challenged moments.</p>
<p><em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&ldquo;And then one day we’ll all cross that river and fight life final war with pain.
And then as death give way to victory
We’ll see the light of glory and l will know he reigns
Because Christ lives we can face tomorrow
Because Christ lives all fear is gone!
And now l know; Yes, l know He holds the future
A life is worth a living just
Because Christ lives ”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></p>
<p>My love, rest well,</p>
<p>Papa Surgy, nante yie,</p>
<p>Richard, ya wo odjogban,</p>
<p>Daddy ,nade  nyuie.</p>
<h2 id="children">Tribute By Children</h2>
<p>There’s nothing sad and painful in this world than watching someone you love so much pass away gradually and not being able to do anything.</p>
<p>On that fateful Wednesday, Mummy asked us to pray fervently because you were in a critical condition. We were hoping to celebrate you back home. Little did we know that a day like this will come.</p>
<p>Daddy, why so early? You were really a great Dad so loving and caring, even for those who are not your biological children. You really had everybody at heart. Truthfulness and humility your rod that guides us. And this is what you have taught us to do. Daddy, we are grateful.</p>
<p>Indeed, our thoughts are not that of the Lord’s, neither our ways are his ways. We strongly believe everything happens for a reason and God does not make mistakes. It is sometimes difficult to accept certain decisions of God, but He knows best.</p>
<p>Daddy, though we stand here with our heavy hearts, we have the assurance that, because you lived a life that glorified God, your maker is going to give you a wonderful place in paradise to intercede on our behalf.</p>
<p>Daddy, to us, as you always travel, this time is one of the many trips. Until we meet again. We love you and you’ll forever remain the best Daddy in our hearts.</p>
<p>Daddy rest well.</p>
<h2 id="church">Tribute By Presbyterian Church of Ghana, Grace Family Congregation - Aborkope</h2>
<p>Our Bible says in Ecclesiastes 3:1&amp;2  <em><!-- raw HTML omitted --> “ for everything there is a  season and a time for every matter under the sun,
…a time to be born and a time to die.”<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></p>
<p><em><!-- raw HTML omitted --> “For in death, there is no remembrance of you…Psalm 6:5” <!-- raw HTML omitted --></em></p>
<p>But today, we honor and celebrate the unwavering dedication and selfless service of the late Mr. Richard Konadu-Asante, a shining example of faith and compassion.</p>

<p>Papa Konadu -Asante (as we commonly call him) was commitment to our church family -Life and had been a constant source of inspiration,  his love for God has been a beacon of light in our lives.               “No man can retain the spirit or power over the day of death” Eccl8:8</p>
<p>For we wish you will stay a bit longer. The Harvest Committee and Tuesday   Borns are already feeling the vacuum created by your absence, the Children and Teachers in the Children’s Service miss you already, you really had them at heart. Your constant visits, monthly stipends given to support their Sunday services to have some sweets which put smiles on their faces generated a nickname for you among the Children Service Teachers “Teacher Konadu”</p>
<p>the Men Fellowship says “Fear not Brother Richard”,</p>
<p>Our Church Choir are today robing your Robes in honor of your contributions in cash and kind during our Church elevation to a full congregation,</p>
<p>Brother Richard Konadu Asante your good deeds we know is ahead of you into eternity. “The one who conquers, will not be hurt by the second death..Rev. 2:11”</p>
<p>May we continue to follow Mr. Konadu Asante’s example, striving to serve with humility, love in piousness , and shine God’s light in our world. Thank you, Mr. Richard Konadu-Asante for being a true disciple and a beloved member of the Grace  family. We celebrate you and your legacy of love!” with the sure hope of us meeting again in the second coming of our Lord Christ Jesus…fare dee Papa Konadu Asante</p>
<p>“We were buried with Him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by glory of the father, we too might walk in the newness of life. Romans 6:45”</p>
<p>Rest well Papa ! You’ll forever remain in our heart!</p>
<h2 id="knust">Tribute By Class of 2006, KNUST</h2>
<p>It is with a heavy heart and fond memories that we write this tribute to our beloved classmate, Pharm. Richard Asante. Our paths first crossed in 2002, when we entered the revered halls of the Faculty of Pharmacy &amp; Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi. From the outset, Richard&rsquo;s affable and easy-going nature made him a cherished member of our cohort.</p>
<p>Known to most of us by his popular nickname, &ldquo;Surgical&rdquo;, Richard&rsquo;s real name remained a mystery to many until our graduation in 2006. This playful anonymity was a testament to his unique charm and the camaraderie we shared during those formative years at the University.</p>
<p>Richard had a clear vision for his future, even during our university days. He aspired to work within the regulatory sector, a path he diligently pursued upon graduation. True to his ambition, Richard joined the Pharmacy Council, where he became an invaluable resource for all of us. Whether it was registration, renewal, or any other regulatory matters, Richard was our go-to person, always ready to lend a helping hand.</p>
<p>Indeed, Richard, or &ldquo;Surgical&rdquo; as we fondly remember him, has left behind an indelible legacy. He was not just a resourceful professional, but also a caring individual who cherished his family and friends. His affable nature, combined with his dedication to his chosen field, made him a role model for many of us.</p>
<p>As we remember Richard, we celebrate his life and the positive impact he had on all of us. His legacy will continue to inspire us, reminding us of the importance of friendship, dedication, and service to others. Richard, you will be sorely missed, but your memory will live on in our hearts. Rest in peace, dear friend.</p>
<h2 id="psgh">Tribute By Pharmaceutical Society Ghana  W/R Chapter</h2>
<p>Like sand through the hour glass, so are the days of our lives.
Pharmacist Richard Asante affably called Surgicals by all who knew him from his days in the faculty of Pharmacy &amp; Pharmaceutical Sciences of KNUST and even into his professional working life thereafter is one that lived a great example of a Pharmacist by being a good friend of the human race.</p>
<p>Rising through the ranks to become the  regional manager for the Pharmacy Council of Ghana in the Western region,he embodied the standards of Pharmacy practice.
Pharm. Richard Asante dispensed his mandate as such in the highest professional candor with diligence and won the heart of both young and old Pharmacists practicing in the region. Intern and student Pharmacists always had an encounter of a lifetime when they met him as he was open, meticulous and a great career coach.
His indepth knowledge and understanding of issues relating to the profession and life at large was indeed a wellspring of life to all who encountered him.
His doors were opened to all colleague Pharmacists and even non Pharmacists on all related issues of Pharmacy practice in the region.
Where it mattered most, he physically was ever present to help administer all regulatory actions to ensure that the standards of practice were rightly upheld.</p>
<p>He was a prominent figure in the regional activities of the PSGH western regional chapter for that matter contributed effortlessly to the successful host of our Society’s AGM in Takoradi for the year 2023.
Fond memories of his participation in meetings with meaningful opinions he advanced all to the betterment of our Society’s regional chapter will be forever cherished.</p>
<p>We as a Regional chapter are lost for words in times like these of our colleague’s demise but in our brief and very last words of tribute to our own departed Pharm. Richard Asante, we seek to say that his exemplary dedication to Pharmacy practice in the Western region remains undisputed and we will continue to eulogize him even as a staunch member that he was.
His name will forever be etched in gold within the annals of the  Society.</p>

<h2 id="alex">Tribute By Pharm Alexander Badong</h2>
<p>It is with a heavy heart that I write this tribute, filled with memories of a friend who was more like a brother to me. We journeyed through life together, from the hallowed halls of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, where we first met, to the bustling institutions where we interned, and across towns and villages in Ghana on our shared holidays. His name was a synonym for camaraderie, laughter, and unwavering friendship.</p>
<p>We were roommates in our final year at the university, a time that brought us closer than ever. We studied together, shared our favorite ‘gobe’ (gari &amp; beans) from Queens Hall, and navigated the challenges of academia. Those walls witnessed our dreams, our struggles, and our triumphs. They heard your unique laughter and our late-night philosophical debates. They were privy to our growing bond with each passing day.</p>
<p>Our internships at the Pharmacy council and Ridge hospital were another chapter of our shared journey. We were two young individuals, stepping into the professional world, eager to make our mark. When the time came to choose our professional registration numbers, we joked that we needed neighboring numbers to remind each other during old age, when memory loss set in. You settled on PA-2413 and I PA-2414. We jested about who will need help from the other in that respect. You were right, even as young people I am the one who often than not came asking about the registration numbers.</p>
<p>Professional life took us in different directions, but we kept close. We were frequent guests at each other’s homes. This summer, we were supposed to add another chapter to our book of shared experiences with a planned European tour, a trip we had worked out with our usual excitement and anticipation. But fate had other plans.</p>
<p>Your untimely passing has left a void that can never be filled. Your laughter, your wisdom, your companionship - they are all irreplaceable. But as we mourn you, we also celebrate your life. We remember you as a wonderful person, for the lives you touched, for the memories you left behind. Your spirit lives on. It lives on in every life you touched, in every heart you warmed, in every dream you inspired.
I bid you farewell ‘papa surgical’, rest in peace my friend. You will forever be missed, but never forgotten.</p>
<h2 id="kwame">Tribute By Pharm Kwame Antwi</h2>
<p>O PharM RicharD Asante!
The very last of my few words in tribute to knowing and relating to you.
You have journeyed to not return.
A too early unexpected exit from life here on earth to join the departed saints.</p>
<p>I  always called you Bra Surgicals and your definitive response always have been Bra Kwame showing the very mutual respect we held even as my Senior colleague until I realized our in-law status.</p>
<p>Aww death, you sting hard and  your sting is the hardest this time.
Rest in ease and rest in peace whilst we continue to deal with the devastating pain of your death.</p>
<p>For one more time I will call Bra Surgicals &amp; say Damirifa !!!</p>
<p>Till we meet on the day of resurrection all I will say is Damirifa !!!</p>
